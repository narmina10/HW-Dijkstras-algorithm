# Djikstra's algorithm

This project is a realization of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths in a weighted graph. It calculates the shortest distance from a starting vertex to all other vertices and then determines the shortest paths from the starting vertex to each vertex. <br>

## How does it work?

Fistly, you enter all the weights in our graph one by one. After that, it shows you the matrix of your graph, shortest distances from your starting vertex to all other vertexes and shortest paths from your starting vertex to all other vertexes.
